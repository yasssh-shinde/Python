## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🔧 **1. Fundamentals**
The building blocks of Python programming—everything you need to write your first programs.
- Installation and environment setup
- Running Python files and scripts
- Variables and data types (int, float, str, bool)
- Input/output operations
- Type casting and conversions
- Operators: arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise

### ⚡ **2. Control Flow**
Master decision-making and loops to control program execution.
- Conditional statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Nested conditions and logic
- Loops: `for` and `while`
- Loop control: `break`, `continue`, `pass`
- Working with `range()`
- Common iteration patterns

### 📦 **3. Data Structures**
Organize and manipulate data efficiently with Python's core data structures.
- **Strings**: slicing, methods, formatting
- **Lists**: manipulation, indexing, methods
- **Tuples**: immutability, unpacking
- **Sets**: uniqueness, operations
- **Dictionaries**: key-value pairs, methods
- Nested data structures
- Mutability rules and best practices

### 🎯 **4. Functions**
Write reusable, modular code with functions.
- Defining and calling functions
- Arguments: positional, keyword, default values
- `*args` and `**kwargs` for flexibility
- Return values and multiple returns
- Scope and namespacing
- Lambda functions for quick operations
- Recursion basics and thinking recursively

### 📂 **5. Modules and Packages**
Organize code and leverage Python's ecosystem.
- Importing modules (import, from...import)
- Creating your own modules
- Standard library exploration
- Virtual environments and dependency management
- Package structure

### 📄 **6. File Handling**
Work with files safely and efficiently.
- Reading files (`.read()`, `.readline()`, `.readlines()`)
- Writing and appending to files
- Working with JSON for data serialization
- Context managers (`with` statement)
- Exception-safe file operations

### ⚠️ **7. Exception Handling**
Write robust code that handles errors gracefully.
- Try-except blocks
- Multiple exception types
- `else` and `finally` blocks
- Raising and creating custom exceptions
- Best practices for error handling

### 🏗️ **8. Object-Oriented Programming**
Build scalable, maintainable programs with OOP principles.
- Classes and objects fundamentals
- Constructors (`__init__`)
- Instance and class variables
- Methods and `self`
- Inheritance and method overriding
- Polymorphism in action
- Encapsulation and access control
- Abstraction principles
- Magic methods (dunder methods): `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__len__`, etc.

### 🚀 **9. Advanced Concepts (Beginner-Friendly)**
Level up with Pythonic techniques and powerful tools.
- List and dictionary comprehensions
- Generator expressions
- Generators and `yield`
- Iterators and the iterator protocol
- Decorators: introduction and practical examples

### 📚 **10. Standard Library Essentials**
Leverage Python's powerful built-in modules.
- `math`: mathematical functions and constants
- `random`: randomization and sampling
- `datetime`: working with dates and times
- `os`: file system operations
- `sys`: system-specific parameters
- `json`: data serialization

### 💻 **11. Mini Projects**
Apply your skills to real-world problems.
- **Calculator**: arithmetic operations with user input
- **To-Do CLI**: task management from the command line
- **File Organizer**: organize files by type or date
- **Password Generator**: create secure passwords
- **Guessing Game**: implement game logic and user interaction

### ⏱️ **12. Prep for Data Structures & Algorithms**
Build foundations for algorithmic thinking.
- Time complexity and Big O notation intuition
- Writing clean, logic-heavy code
- Recognizing and solving common patterns
- Introduction to algorithm design
